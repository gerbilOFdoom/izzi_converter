## Purpose

This script was created to convert individual sample files previously
made by Data Splitter into PmagPy generic format. Files produced by this 
script can be used with PmagPy and paleointensity.org. 

## Inputs

This script requires .dat files that you want converted placed into the
/input/ folder. 

## Outputs

This script will create converted files with the same name. 
The converted files will write to the /output/ folder. 

## Notes

This script was made in conjunction with the Data Splitter script.
It is intended to be used afterwards to convert data to PmagPy generic/paleointensity.org friendly formats.
